<Alert> This tutorial is an interactive version of the hands-on steps described in the <Link href="https://labs.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/book/">Data and Text Processing for Health and Life Sciences</Link> book. The contents are the same, but access to data via curl is not possible, so the tutorial will use local files. </Alert>

The goal is to describe the manual steps that health and life science specialists may have to perform to find and retrieve biomedical data and text. We will use the compound caffeine as an example and go through different public repositories until we find diseases somehow related to it. The idea is not about the relationships we may find, but the journey of how to get them.
