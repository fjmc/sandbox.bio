<Alert> These tutorials are an interactive version of the hands-on steps described in the [Data and Text Processing for Health and Life Sciences](https://labs.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/book/) book. The contents are the same, but access to data via curl is not possible, so the tutorial will use local files. </Alert>

# Unix Shell

The tutorial series will describe how shell scripting can be used to perform the steps that health and life science specialists may need to take to find and retrieve biomedical data and text. We will use the compound caffeine as an example and navigate through different public repositories to find diseases related to it. The focus is not on the specific relationships we may find, but on the process of how to obtain them.

The objective of this first tutorial is to learn how to create and use data and script files in a Unix shell.
